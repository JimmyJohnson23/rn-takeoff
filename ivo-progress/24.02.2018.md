# [Azat Mardan's React Native Quicly Book](https://github.com/azat-co/react-native-quickly/blob/master/manuscript/chapter01.md)

I made a little research about Azat & he seems some sort of Node guru..if I like the info in this book I'll search for his infos about Node when I get there.
I'll read this book as some guy from fcc gitter recommended it & I also noticed it has two small projects with RN,so it fits perfect for my needs.

## Notes

* React Native apps are not the same as hybrid or so-called HTML5 apps. If you are not familiar with the hybrid approach, it's when there's a website wrapped in a headless browser. A headless browser is a browser view without the URL bar or navigation buttons.

* Among the most popular frameworks for hybrid apps are **Sencha Touch, Apache Cordova, PhoneGap, and Ionic.**

* A React Native app, on the other hand, is not a website wrapped in a headless browser. It's native Objective C or Java code that communicates with React's JavaScript. This allows for the following benefits over native development:

  1. Flexbox layout system. This is a synthesized system for layouts that is similar to CSS and allows for cross-platform development.

  2. Hot/live reload

  3. Chrome debugging. Developers can use the already familiar DevTools.

  4. Use native elements, which are better and more powerful than web tech (the HTML5/wrapper approach).
