# React Native Tutorial [Link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html)

## 1.Basics

`React Native` is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, `state`, and `props`.

### Simple Hello World

```Javascript

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

export default class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Text>Hello world!</Text>
    );
  }
}

```

### JSX

The other unusual thing in this code example is `<Text>Hello world!</Text>`.

This is JSX..a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript.

Lots of frameworks use a special templating language that allows embedding code inside the markup lang.

**In React,this is opposite..JSX allows you to write your markup language inside the code**

## 2.Props

Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters.
These creation parameters are called `props`.

For example, one basic React Native component is the `Image`.
When you create an image, you can use a prop named `source` to control what image it shows.

```Javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Image } from 'react-native';

export default class Bananas extends Component {
  render() {
    let pic = {
      uri: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Bananavarieties.jpg'
    };
    return (
      <Image source={pic} style={{width: 193, height: 110}}/>
    );
  }
}

// skip this line if using Create React Native App
AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => Bananas);

```

Your own components can also use props. This lets you make a single component that is used in many different places in your app,
with slightly different properties in each place. Just refer to this.props in your render function.

```JavaScript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Text>Hello {this.props.name}!</Text>
    );
  }
}

export default class LotsOfGreetings extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{alignItems: 'center'}}>
        <Greeting name='Rexxar' />
        <Greeting name='Jaina' />
        <Greeting name='Valeera' />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

// skip this line if using Create React Native App
AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => LotsOfGreetings);
```
The other new thing going on here is the `View` component. A `View` is useful as a container for other components,
to help control style and layout.

With props and the basic `Text`, `Image`, and `View` components, you can build a wide variety of static screens.


## State

To learn how to make your app change over time, you need to learn about `State`.

There are two types of data that control a `component`:
..* props
..* state

`props` are set by the **parent** and they are fixed throughout the **lifetime of a component**.

For data that is going to change, we have to use `state`.

For example, let's say we want to make text that blinks all the time.

1.The text itself gets set once when the blinking component gets created, so the text itself is a `prop`.

2.The "whether the text is currently on or off" changes over time, so that should be kept in `state`.

```JavaScript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';

class Blink extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isShowingText: true};

    // Toggle the state every second
    setInterval(() => {
      this.setState(previousState => {
        return { isShowingText: !previousState.isShowingText };
      });
    }, 1000);
  }

  render() {
    let display = this.state.isShowingText ? this.props.text : ' ';
    return (
      <Text>{display}</Text>
    );
  }
}

export default class BlinkApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Blink text='I love to blink' />
        <Blink text='Yes blinking is so great' />
        <Blink text='Why did they ever take this out of HTML' />
        <Blink text='Look at me look at me look at me' />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

// skip this line if using Create React Native App
AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => BlinkApp);
```
